Just seven questions I will turn it into a blog post.

***
q1. What project have you worked on do you wish you could go back to,
and do better?

I started my career as a quant in a small startup hedge fund
developing time series models to forecast short-term volatility in
equities and equity indices as part of an option trading strategy. It
is a fascinating topic and I have been working on it for years,
finally discovering R and then switching over almost all the logic to
it. Thinking back, I would re-engineer large portions of it and I made
a ton of mistakes on both the modelling and implementation side. For
example, the system automatically generates PDF reports of the
forecasts but it does so by hand creating latex files that are then
compiled into PDF. One of the first things I would do is switch all
that over to use either 'knitr' or 'rmarkdown'.

That said, I had worked on the modelling for a long time, so I am
fairly happy with the basic model, though there was still loads of
extra stuff to both investigate and implement.

On the modelling side, I worked on a persistency model using survival
analysis, which is how I learned about the subject in the first
place. As a result, there are a lot of different things I would love
to return to and do differently. In retrospect, I was too quick to
move past the simpler models. We could see the assumptions were not
consistent with the data, and so did not fully explore simpler
approaches. I am now curious to learn what insights those simpler
approaches would yield.

Hopefully I will be involved in something similar in the future and
have the ability to apply those lessons.

q2. What advice do you have to younger analytics professionals and in
particular PhD students in the Sciences?

I think the key advice I would give is the same for everyone - never
stop learning. This may be the availability heuristic at play with me,
but I have never seen a connection between qualifications and the
quality of the analyst. All the good analysts I have met are so
because they have initiative.

Initiative manifests in many ways. First, when they encounter a
problem they learn what they need to do and get on with it. Second,
much of their knowledge is self-taught. Finally, and I believe most
importantly, they have an inherent curiosity - the best analysts I
know engage in the field in their own time, mainly because they want
to.

This brings up a related issue I have been formulating for some
time. I want to be really good. While probably not as fanatic as the
average fan, I do have an interest in sport such as Soccer, the NFL
and Gaelic Football. For anyone who has met me in person, the
following comment is going to appear preposterous, but I think there
is a lot to be learned from how top atheletes prepare and train. I
appreciate these principles also likely apply to other professions,
but it is more fun to talk about sport. :)

q3. What do you wish you knew earlier about being a data scientist?

q4. How do you respond when you hear the phrase 'big data'?

I hate it because it has become a meaningess buzzword largely used as
a means of making sales. It also seems to be much more in the realm of
engineering than statistics or data analysis.

My attitude to the term is best summarised by the interview you had
with Hadley Wickham a while back: there are three categories of data
size, in-memory, on-disk and then truely massive problems like
recommender systems etc. I think a very large majority of problems can
be solved by appropriate sampling of your data down to a manageable
size and then analysing those subsets.

The whole point of statistics is to make inferences about a population
from a sample of the data.

Of course, once decided on a solution, putting the model into
production and scaling it for your business is also an issue, but that
is a problem more belonging to the realm of network and software
engineering. That said, it is important to keep people with a solid
understanding of the concepts stay involved, just in case some
'optimisations' ruin the output.

q5. What is the most exciting thing about your field?

Robert McNamara in 'The Fog of War' mentioned that you should never
answer the question asked but instead answer the question you wanted
to be asked, so with your forebearance I will first answer a liberal
interpretation of that question: what work gets me excited?

The short answer to that question is varied, all sorts of things do,
but it tends to be very specific thing I am working on. In the last
few months, I was excited to try out dataexpks on a brand new data set
to see what it showed me and how well it worked. I love think of ways
to use Monte Carlo simulation to test the output of various regression
models, and over Xmas I was fascinated by working on different ways to
investigate differences between a subpopulation within a larger
population.

I love discovering new ways to learn the basics - there are a few
excellent ones out there and I read them all the time. I can never
learn enough about ways to think about the basics as in my experience
reality tends to present us with basic statistical problems in new and
unusual ways.

Having multiple perspectives and multiple approaches is invaluable in
those situations.

Regarding your original question

q6. How do you go about framing a data problem - in particular, how do
you avoid spending too long, how do you manage expectations etc. How
do you know what is good enough?

q7. You've spoken before about the 'need for apprenticeships' in Data
Science. Do you have any suggestions on what that would involve? Are
meetups and coaching a good first start?
